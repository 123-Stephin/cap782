                <h2>PECK DECK MACHINE</h2>
                <p>
                    A pec deck is a machine designed to increase strength and muscle mass in the chest. Itâ€™s so effective that the American Council on Exercise ranked it as one of the best exercises for building chest muscles.
                    The pec deck works both your chest and its supporting muscles, primarily your pectoralis major, which is the muscle that allows you to swing and bring your arms together.
